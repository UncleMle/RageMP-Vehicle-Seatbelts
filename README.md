# RageMP-Vehicle-Seatbelts
A simple script that adds vehicle seatbelts to vehicles with a certain class. This stops the player from falling out of the windscreen of the vehicle. 

I created a custom notification system that is still on this. You can add in your own notification system or you can just print it into chat with mp.gui.chat.push.
